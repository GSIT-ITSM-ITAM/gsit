## Introduction

This version is a secure and cleaned fork version of [GLPI](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/).

The patches are maintened by DCS EASYWARE, by the `Innovation and expertise center` of company [DCSEASYWARE](https://www.dcsit-group.com/).


## Why this version ?

We maintain this version because not agree with some features that seems not secured for us (like marketplace) and too many messages about glpi-network.



# Releases

The first version is the 9.5 version, copy of GLPI 9.5 version but secured.
The second (in dev now), is the 1.0.0 version, with 95% of code rewritten.


# Availability of code

To be right with the license `GNU General Public License v2`, the code source and the patches are available in this repository.
